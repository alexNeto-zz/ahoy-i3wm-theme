# My i3wm desktop config

Initially made for personal use, but released to encourage me to keep maintaining this theme and learn more about __i3wm__

I use these theme in the __arch linux__, but also used it in the __fedora 24__
## Color set
There are two color set, a dark and a light one, if you want to use the dark, you will have to modify the shell scripts to a lighter collor
